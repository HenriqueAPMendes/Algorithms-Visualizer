# Algorithms_Visualizer

A desktop app for visualizing common algorithms.

## How this works

## Requirements

This works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. You'll need `cmake` and a C++ compiler (tested on `clang`, `gcc`, and MSVC).

Linux builds require the GTK3 library and headers installed in the system.

## Building

To build the project, use:

```bash
cmake -S. -Bbuild
cmake --build build
```

This will create a directory named `build` and create all build artifacts there. The main executable can be found in the `build/subprojects/Build/Algorithms_Visualizer_core` folder.
